The Choreo Music Helper is an Android app to support everyone,
who wants to perform to a specific song. In those cases, the
user(s) normally needs to train very often to one specific
song or even small part of the track.

Therefore the Choreo Music Helper allows the user to split the
song into smaller tracks, which can be looped, have some
lead-in/-out time to prepare for the next iteration and change
the speed.

For this requirement only a handful of songs should be added to
the App, so you don't have to search long during a training
session.

<i>What is this app NOT?</i>

This app is not a full music library to manage hundreds of
songs. If you want this, search for another app.

<i>Notes</i>

This app is totally free, does not include any adds and does
not track you in any way. It's also Open source, and the
source code and further help can be found at
https://github.com/yoadey/choreomusic. Feel free to open an
issue there if you miss something or have other feature
requests.
